# [Learn Python](https://t-naing.github.io/learn-python/)  

Welcome to my very first web page! This site provides Python learning resources for beginners, covering both programming fundamentals and data analysis basics.  

### Available resources:  
- **Python language basics**  
- **Data analysis fundamentals**  

## Note  
Some of [Jovian](https://jovian.ai/)'s learning materials have transitioned to a paid model, though I couldn't find details on when this shift occurred. However, select courses and certain sections of existing courses remain freely accessible. This information was last revised on April 22, 2025.
