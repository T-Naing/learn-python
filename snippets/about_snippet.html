    <p data-key="about-p1">My name is Naing, and I am currently learning Python. I've also ventured into HTML to create my very
      first web page. If you'd like to reach out to me, feel free to contact me via <a

      By the way, here’s a view of my hometown—captivating, isn’t it? Nestled in scenic hills, it offers breathtaking
      views. How I love this place! It may be just a town, but it’s my hometown after all. Can you guess where it is?
